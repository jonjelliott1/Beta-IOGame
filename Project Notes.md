# Project Notes for Beta-IOGame

## About Project
I really enjoy playing slither.io and a few other IO games when I have a spare minute.
I thought it would be a lot of fun to create my own IO game, just to better appreciate how they work and the technology involved.

### Method
I am going to start out by following https://victorzhou.com/blog/build-an-io-game-part-1/
Victor Zhou's guide that he published April 25th 2019 on "How to Build a Multiplayer (.io) Web Game"

### Success Criteria

In order to be successful the following criteria need to be met:

1. Must be able to be played from a web browser.
2. No registration is required (Type a name and hit play).
3. Must be multiplayer.

Let's commit this and get started.
